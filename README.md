This repository contains Various Stochastic MCMC methods for Bayesian regression with variance reduction (control variate at the level of the drift using MAP estimate, antithetic MLMC or antithetic MIMC) using Pytorch and Automatic Differentation:
- MASGA (Multi-index Antithetic Stochastic Gradient Algorithm). Using Multi-index and antithetic samples at the level of the time discretisation and subsampling on the Stochastic Langevin SDE.

- Stochastic Langevin Dynamics using Control Variate to reduce the variance of the drift estimator. The control variate is given by an estimator of the MAP of the posterior. This algorithm is taken from the paper [Control Variates for Stochastic Gradient MCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05439) and is used for benchmarking purposes. 


For the MLMC and MIMC part of the code, code initially based on https://bitbucket.org/pefarrell/pymlmc/src/master/.
